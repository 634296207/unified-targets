# Betaflight Unified Target Configuration Repository


## ATTENTION

Instructions have been updated as Betaflight requires certification as we are migrating to a new build API.

Manufacturers can contact us on Discord to be part of our certification program.


## Manufacturer Design Guidelines

Read the [hardware specification](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/Manafacturer%20Design%20Guidelines.md).


## Build API

All targets need to include #defines for drivers to be included for hardware drivers, including accelerometer, barometer, gyro, magnetometer and OSD.

Please update all existing targets. See instructions below for more details.

Betaflight will include a certified flag as new hardware specification requirements will be in place to improve quality. Documentation with more detailed guidelines will be provided on further notice.


## Instructions

Please follow [these instructions](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/blob/master/docs/TargetMaintenance/CreatingAUnifiedTarget.md) to create and publish a Unified Target configuration.
